# nginx + spdy + pagespeed #

`install.sh` bash script is able to compile:
- a parametric nginx version
	- with a parametric openssl version   
	- with a parametric pagespeed module version
	- with spdy protocol supported by default. 

## Binary ##

The compiled binary right now is placed in the `output` folder and will be created at the same level of the install script.
